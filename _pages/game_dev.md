I’m learning to make video games in my free time (which I don’t really have much.)<br>
Here are things I've worked on.

**Shadow’s Edge:** my very first game jam entry for *Ludum Dare 54 Compo*.<br>
[Click here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/shadows-edge) for original LD54 page.


**Kitchen Chaos:** practice project, assets borrowed from [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg).
