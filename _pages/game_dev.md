I’m learning to make video games in my free time (which I don’t really have much.)<br>
Here are things I've worked on.

**Shadow’s Edge:** A 2D platform game. Also my very first game jam entry for *Ludum Dare 54 Compo*.<br>

***[In Progress]*****Summoned:** made for *Ludum Dare 55 Compo*, but progress was interrupted by school commitments. More to come soon. 


**Kitchen Chaos:** An Overcooked-type practice project, assets borrowed from this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg).
