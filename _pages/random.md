**Rock Climbing, mostly bouldering**

Very stereotypical for a CS person, but TRUE. I started in my Freshman Spring and have been obsessed ever since. 

I also worked at the school rock wall @ Palladium 2022-23. Most of the time I was belaying people and explaining the rules, but we also got to strip the wall, wash the holds, and set new routes between semesters. Check out a route I set below.

**Orienteering**

Running is boring, but navigating and treasure hunting is something else.

I used to be on my high school orienteering team, but I haven’t done much since college. It’s tough to join competitions or events in the US without a car.

**Traveling (along)**

I have been very blessed with the opportunity to travel a lot, and I really enjoyed the complete freedom of doing it solo. 

As a kid I obviously had to go with my parents, but sometimes we just have different interests. The summer before high school we went to Japan. My mom, being an architect would like to explore the city, but I had my own plans: a live concert, Disney, and Comiket 90. We ended up splitting up during the day and reuniting at night, which worked out perfectly.

As a young adult people often travel with friends, but sometimes (or, most of the time) we just have incompatible schedules. During sophomore summer I spent three months traveling alone in Europe. Of course it wasn’t life-changing, but I got the chance to immerse in museums for days and be better at planning, communicating, and improvising. 

I’ve also visited every Disney Resort and Universal Studios (except the new one in Beijing) all on my own. Being a single rider with a plan, it’s surprisingly easy to hit every ride—even during summer break. Profile pic is me with Todd at USJ, taken by a super kind staff member.

I’m obsessed with rollercoasters and free-fall rides because I love the feeling of weightlessness, but lately, they’ve all started to feel less thrilling. Let me know if you have a place in mind with best thrill rides. Or should I just go for bungee jumping next?
